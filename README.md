# sotoriio

My own super-simple version of Foriio, using their public API.
Made with Next.JS (React) and Redux.

Hosted version is here: [sotoriio.sutu.re](https://sotoriio.sutu.re)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Next App](https://github.com/segmentio/create-next-app).

To run locally:
```
$ cd <path-to-sotoriio>

$ yarn
- or -
$ npm install

$ yarn dev
- or -
$ npm run dev
```
